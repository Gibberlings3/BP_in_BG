<h1>Taking you to the Black Pits within the BG1 campaign in BGEE, SoD, and EET</h1>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showuser=6306">Duns Scotus, the SubtleDoctor</a><br />
</p>
  <p><strong> Version 1.2 </strong><br />
    <strong> Languages:</strong> English, French<br />
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod adds a new encounter with Baeloth to the BG1 campaign. He intends to abduct you and take you to the Black Pits. You can choose in dialogue whether you want to go there, but either offering to fight (in a sense), or intimidating Baeloth so he backs off.</p>
  <p>This cut scene occurs at the beginning of chapter 7, after you escape Candlekeep. The early BP fights are easy but the later ones are designed for parties around 8th-10th level. Hopefully you should be at least 7th level before going there.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> because going to the Black Pits changes Baeloth into a significant adversary, Baeloth cannot join your party after you finish the Black Pits adventure. He will disappear from the BG1 campaign, and he will be blocked from joining Charname in SoD if you continue into that campaign in EET.</p>
  <p>This mod does not change the Black Pits standalone campaign, if you start it directly with a custom-made party. But if you travel there from within the BG campaign, there will be some changes:
  <ul>
    <li>There will be no Quest XP awarded between fights.</li>
    <li>(You will still gain XP from defeating enemies, though.)</li>
    <li>The gold rewards from winning fights is <b>substantially</b> reduced. (About 1/4.)</li>
    <li>The BP vendors will not sell as many copies of most items.</li>
    <li>The BP vendors will have some items <b>removed</b> from their stores.</li>
    <li>However, there will be a bunch of new items added to their third-tier stores, mostly moderately-powered stuff from Icewind Dale.</li>
    <li>If you go to the Black Pits this way, you do NOT end up with geas rings on. This means party members can die in the arena! There are five Raise Dead scrolls for sale by Dinguer the Mad, but you should be careful! Also, if anyone dies in a fight, even if you can Raise them afterward, don't forget to grab their equipment from the arena!</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows:</strong><br />
    The mod archive should be extracted into your game folder from the archive (or just unzipped and then copied there). If properly extracted, you should have a "d5_random_tweaks" folder and "setup-Bp_in_BG.exe" in your game folder. To install, simply double-click "setup-Bp_in_BG.exe" and then follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>MacOS:</strong><br />
    This mod is not packaged with a particular MacOS installer. The easiest way to install it is to place the mod folder into your game directory and then use <a href="https://github.com/subtledoctor/MacOS_Weidu_Launcher/releases">the Weidu Launcher</a> (MWL). Simply double-click the MWL, choose "Bp_in_BG" from the list, and then follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod should be installed VERY early since it (currently) overwrites several dialogue files: Baeloth's dialogues in BGEE and Sod, and the BP shop vendors' dialogues. It should be installed <b>after</b> EET if you are installing this in an EET game. In that case probably best to install it immediately after EET.</p>
